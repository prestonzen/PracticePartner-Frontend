- Getting Started
Available Scripts
```
npm start
npm test
npm run build
npm run eject
```

Available Scripts
Inside the root directory of this project, these npm scripts help manage different stages of our application lifecycle:
```
npm start
```
Runs the app in development mode. Opens http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Page refreshes automatically upon saving file modifications. Linter warnings or error messages appear in the terminal.
```
npm test
```
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For details regarding testing setup, refer to Running Tests.
```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for deployment to the 'build' folder. Optimized code for better performance; includes hash values within filename for cache busting purposes. Ready for hosting after building. Checkout Deployment Guide for further instructions.
```
npm run eject
```
Use caution as this action cannot be undone. Removes the default build tools by duplicating their configurations directly inside the project instead. Provides complete flexibility to modify settings like webpack, babel, eslint, etc., however requires manual maintenance thereafter.
